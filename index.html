		<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Maps showing comments relating to FCC Proceedings 14-115 and 14-115.</p>

		<h3>Methodology</h3>
			<p>The data was pulled from the Federal Communications Commission’s Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS) public database for the two petitions from the City of Wilson, North Carolina (WC Docket No. 14-115) and the Electric Power Board of Chattanooga, Tennessee (WC Docket No. 14-116) to preempt state bans prohibiting municipal broadband networks. Each filing was coded by type of filer and whether the filing was in favor, against or neutral. Individual filers were categorized as individuals. Federal, state or local government entities as well as public officials writing from their public email addresses were categorized as “government.” Other filers, including companies, trade groups, associations, and public interest groups were categorized as “entities.” The filers’ locations were coded by physical address.</p>
